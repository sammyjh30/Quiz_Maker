To run the angular project do the following:

Open CMD in the QuizMakerAngular
Type in npm install the first time and it will install all the dependancies
Type in ng serve -o (-o makes it open in a browser for you) in the CMD window to open the project once it is done installing

To run the node project do the following: 
Open CMD in the QuizMakerNode 
Type in npm install for the first time and it will install all the dependancies
Type nodemon app.js in the CMD window 
You will then have to go to localhost:theportnumber to see it running


both of these methods will reload as you make changes to the files so should be nice and chilled to work with. Just save and it'll reload
